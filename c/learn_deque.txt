Hereâ€™s a practical checklist for learning deques (double-ended queues):

**Core Operations:**
1. Insert at the front.
2. Insert at the back.
3. Delete from the front.
4. Delete from the back.
5. Peek at the front element.
6. Peek at the back element.
7. Check if the deque is empty.
8. Print all elements.
9. Free the entire deque.

**Implementation Approaches:**
- Doubly linked list (most flexible for dynamic size).
- Circular buffer (array-based, fixed size, efficient for some cases).

**Bonus Concepts:**
- Implement a deque using a doubly linked list in C.
- Compare performance and use-cases with stacks and queues.
- Explore real-world applications (e.g., undo/redo, sliding window algorithms).

**Suggested Practice:**
Try implementing a deque in C using a doubly linked list. Practice all the operations above. If you need help or want feedback, share your code!
