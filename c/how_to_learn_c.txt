Yes, there's a more effective approach for 42 specifically:

1. Build your own libft first - implement the standard C library functions yourself. This reinforces fundamentals while directly preparing you for your first project.

2. Create small projects that mimic 42's constraints:
   - No standard library except what's explicitly allowed
   - Follow the Norm coding style
   - Focus on memory management without leaks

3. Work through "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie, doing all exercises. This book aligns well with 42's philosophy.

4. Join study groups with other 42 students - peer learning is central to the 42 model.

5. When doing practice problems, focus on:
   - Implementing data structures from scratch
   - File handling and I/O
   - Pointer manipulation and memory allocation

This approach will prepare you better for 42's specific evaluation system than generic LeetCode problems alone.
